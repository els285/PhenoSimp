# PhenoSimp
Wrapper for tools I use for particle physics phenomenology.

`MadLAD` is used to generate MC simulation. The software run in custom singularity containers.

`mad4condor` contains a set of wrappers for running MadLAD and post-processessing MadLAD outputs via HTCondor.

`tools` contains scripts for downstream analysis of LHE, HepMC and ROOT files.
